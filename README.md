# evostream-stats

evostream-stats is a small ruby application (build on top of [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)).
It collects events send by [Evostream Media Server](http://evostream.com/), and provides a [d3](http://d3js.org) featured small frontend to view statistics.

It was build for the [sublan.tv](http://sublan.tv) project, but may be useful in other areas, too.
